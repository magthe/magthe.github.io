<p>
In <code>modus-theme</code> 5.0.0 Prot introduced a structured way to build a theme based
on modus. Just a few days ago he released version 5.1.0 with some improvements
in this area.
</p>

<p>
The official documentation of how to <a href="https://protesilaos.com/emacs/modus-themes#h:86eb375b-9be4-43ce-879a-0686a524a63b">build on top of the Modus themes</a> is very
good. It's focused on how to make sure your theme fits in with the rest of the
"modus universe". However, after reading it I still didn't have a good idea of
how to get started with my own theme. In case others feel the same way I thought
I'd write down how I ended up getting started.
</p>

<p>
The resulting theme, <code>modus-catppuccin</code>, can be found <a href="https://gitlab.com/magus/modus-catppuccin">here</a>.
</p>
<div id="outline-container-org4839f2f" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org4839f2f">A little background</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org4839f2f">
<p>
I read about how to <a href="https://www.rahuljuliato.com/posts/modus-catppuccin">create a catppuccin-mocha theme using modus-vivendi</a> through
modus' mechanism of overrides. On Reddit someone pointed out that Prot had been
working on basing themes on modus and when I checked the state of it he'd just
released version 5.0.0. Since I'm using catppuccin themes for pretty much all
software with a GUI I thought it could be interesting to see if I could make a
modus-based catppuccin theme to replace my use of <a href="https://github.com/catppuccin/emacs"><code>catppuccin-theme</code></a>.
</p>

<p>
I'm writing the rest as if it was a straight and easy journey. It wasn't! I made
a few false starts, each time realising something new about the structure and
starting over with a better idea.
</p>

<h2 id="org61bc0bd">Finding a starting point</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org61bc0bd">
<p>
When reading what Prot had written about <code>modus-themes</code> in general, and about
how to create themes based on it, in particular, I found that he's ported both
<a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/standard-themes"><code>standard-themes</code></a> and <a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/ef-themes"><code>ef-themes</code></a> so they now are based on modus. Instead of
just using them for inspiration I decided that since <code>standard-themes</code> is so
small I might as well use it as my starting point.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org8f0c803" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org8f0c803">Starting</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org8f0c803">
<p>
I copied all files of <code>standard-themes</code> to an empty git repository, then I
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>deleted all but one of the theme file</li>
<li>copied the remaining theme file so I had four in total (one for each of the
<a href="https://catppuccin.com/palette/">catppuccin flavours</a>)</li>
<li>renamed constants, variables, and functions so they would match the
theme and its flavours</li>
<li>put the colours into each <code>catppuccin-&lt;flavour&gt;-palette</code></li>
<li>emptied the common palette, <code>modus-catppuccin-common-palette-mappings</code></li>
<li>made sure that my use of <code>modus-themes-theme</code> was reasonable, in particular
the base palette (I based the light flavour on <code>modus-operandi</code> and the three
dark flavours on <code>modus-vivendi</code>)</li>
</ul>

<p>
The result can be seen <a href="https://gitlab.com/magus/modus-catppuccin/-/tree/c86e17d29e0fc8f0d4a6a2e94a475f32037d2851">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
At this point the three theme flavours contained no relevant mappings of their
own, so what I had was in practice <code>modus-operandi</code> under a new name and
<code>modus-vivendi</code> under three new names.

<h2 id="org28309d9">Adding mappings for catppuccin</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org28309d9">
<p>
By organising the theme flavours the way outlined above I only need to add
mappings to <code>modus-catppuccin-common-palette-mappings</code> because
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>each flavour-specific mapping adds its colour palette using the same name
(that's how catppuccin organises its colors too, <a href="https://catppuccin.com/palette/">as seen here</a>)</li>
<li>each flavour-specific mapping is combined with the common one</li>
<li>any missing mapping is picked up by the underlying theme, <code>modus-operandi</code> or
<code>modus-vivendi</code>, so there will be (somewhat) nice colours for everything</li>
</ol>

<p>
I started out with the mappings in the <a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/standard-themes/blob/main/standard-dark-theme.el">dark standard theme</a> but then I realised
that's not the complete list of available mappings and I started looking at the
themes in <code>modus-themes</code> itself.

<h2 id="orgeb19297">Current state of <code>modus-catppuccin</code></h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgeb19297">
<p>
I've so far defined enough mappings to make it look enough like catppuccin for
my use. There are a lot of possible mappings so my plan is to add them over time
and use <a href="https://github.com/catppuccin/emacs"><code>catppuccin-theme</code></a> for inspiration.
