The other day I added some more logging into a service at work, but not all logs
appeared in Kibana. Some messages got lost between CloudWatch Logs and
Elasticsearch. After turning up the logging in the Lambda shuffling log messages
I was in for a bit of learning about Elasticsearch.
</p>

<p>
Running the following in a Kibana console will show what the issue was
</p>

<pre class="example" id="orgdf8782c">
PUT idx-0/_doc/1
{
  "name": "John",
  "full_name": "John Doe"
}

PUT idx-0/_doc/2
{
  "name": "Jane",
  "full_name": {
    "first": "Jane",
    "last": "Doe"
  }
}
</pre>

<p>
Executing them in order results in the following error on the second command
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-js"><span class="org-rainbow-delimiters-depth-1">{</span>
  <span class="org-string">"error"</span>: <span class="org-rainbow-delimiters-depth-2">{</span>
    <span class="org-string">"root_cause"</span>: <span class="org-rainbow-delimiters-depth-3">[</span>

      <span class="org-rainbow-delimiters-depth-4">}</span>

    <span class="org-string">"type"</span>: <span class="org-string">"mapper_parsing_exception"</span>,
    <span class="org-string">"reason"</span>: <span class="org-string">"failed to parse field [full_name] of type [text]"</span>,
    <span class="org-string">"caused_by"</span>: <span class="org-rainbow-delimiters-depth-3">{</span>
      <span class="org-string">"type"</span>: <span class="org-string">"illegal_state_exception"</span>,

  <span class="org-rainbow-delimiters-depth-2">}</span>,
  <span class="org-string">"status"</span>: <span class="org-highlight-numbers-number">400</span>
<span class="org-rainbow-delimiters-depth-1">}</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
The reason for this is that a schema for the data is built up dynamically as
documents are pushed in.<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup> It is possible to turn off dynamic schema
building for an index using a <a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/dynamic-mapping.html">mapping</a>. For the documents above it'd look
something lik this
</p>

<pre class="example" id="org38649e6">
PUT idx-0
{
  "mappings": {
    "_doc": {
      "dynamic": false
    }
  }
}
</pre>

<p>
Now it's possible to push both documents, however searching is not possible,
because, as the <a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/dynamic.html">documentation for <code>dynamic</code></a> says:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
fields will not be indexed so will not be searchable but will still appear in
the _source field of returned hits
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
If there's something that determines the value of logs it's them being
searchable.
</p>

<p>
As far as I understand one solution to all of this would have been <a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/mapping.html#mapping-type">mapping
types</a>, but that's being removed (see <a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/removal-of-types.html">removal of mapping types</a>) so isn't a
solution. I'm not sure if Elasticsearch offers any <i>good</i> solution to it
nowadays. There's however a workaround, more indices.
</p>

<p>
Using two indices instead of one does work. So modifying the first commands to
use separate indices works.
</p>

<pre class="example" id="org79cd6b0">
PUT idx-0/_doc/1
{
  "name": "John",
  "full_name": "John Doe"
}

PUT idx-1/_doc/1
{
  "name": "Jane",
  "full_name": {
    "first": "Jane",
    "last": "Doe"
  }
}
</pre>

<p>
When creating an index pattern for <code>idx-*</code> there's a warning about many analysis
functions not working due to the type conflict. However, searching <i>does</i> work
and that's all I really care about in this case.
</p>

<p>
When shuffling the logs from CloudWatch Logs to Elasticsearch we already use
multiple indices. They're constructed based on service name, deploy environment
(<i>staging</i>, <i>production</i>) and date (a new index each day). To deal with these
type conflicts I added a <i>log type</i> that's taken out of the log message itself.
It's not an elegant solution &#x2013; it puts the solution into the services
themselves &#x2013; but it's acceptable.

<h2 class="footnotes">Footnotes: </h2>
<div id="text-footnotes">

<div class="footdef"><sup><a id="fn.1" class="footnum" href="#fnr.1">1</a></sup> <div class="footpara"><p class="footpara">
Something that makes me wonder what the definition of <i>schema-free</i> is. I
sure didn't expect there to ever be a type constraint preventing pushing a
document into something that's called schema-free (see the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elasticsearch">Wikipedia article</a>).
(The initiated say it's Lucene, not Elasticsearch, but to me that doesn't make
any difference at all.)
