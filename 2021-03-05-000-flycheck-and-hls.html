<p>
I've been using LSP for most programming languages for a while now. HLS is
really very good now, but I've found that it doesn't warn on quite all things
I'd like it to so I find myself having to swap between the <code>'lsp</code> and
<code>'haskell-ghc</code> checkers. However, since <a href="https://www.flycheck.org/en/latest/">flycheck</a> supports chaining checkers I
thought there must be a way to have both checkers active at the same time.
</p>

<p>
The naive approach didn't work due to load order of things in Spacemacs so I had
to experiment a bit to find something that works.
</p>

<p>
The first issue was to make sure that HLS is available at all. I use <code>shell.nix</code>
together with <a href="https://direnv.net/">direnv</a> extensively and I had noticed that <code>lsp-mode</code> tried to load
HLS before <code>direnv</code> had put it in the <code>$PATH</code>. I think the
<code>'lsp-beforeinitialize-hook</code> is the hook to use for this:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp"><span class="org-rainbow-delimiters-depth-1">(</span>add-hook 'lsp-before-initialize-hook #'direnv-update-environment<span class="org-rainbow-delimiters-depth-1">)</span><span class="org-rainbow-delimiters-unmatched">)</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
I made a several attempt to chain the checkers but kept on getting
errors due to the <code>'lsp</code> checker not being defined yet. Another problem
I ran into was that the checkers were chained too late, resulting in
having to manually run <code>flycheck-buffer</code> on the first file I opened.
(Deferred loading is a brilliant thing, but make some things really
difficult to debug.) After quite a bit of experimenting and reading the
description of various hooks I did find something that works:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp"><span class="org-rainbow-delimiters-depth-1">(</span><span class="org-keyword">with-eval-after-load</span> 'lsp-mode
  <span class="org-rainbow-delimiters-depth-2">(</span><span class="org-keyword">defun</span> <span class="org-function-name">magthe:lsp-next-checker</span> <span class="org-rainbow-delimiters-depth-3">()</span>
    <span class="org-rainbow-delimiters-depth-3">(</span>flycheck-add-next-checker 'lsp '<span class="org-rainbow-delimiters-depth-4">(</span>warning . haskell-ghc<span class="org-rainbow-delimiters-depth-4">)</span><span class="org-rainbow-delimiters-depth-3">)</span><span class="org-rainbow-delimiters-depth-2">)</span>
  <span class="org-rainbow-delimiters-depth-2">(</span>add-hook 'lsp-lsp-haskell-after-open-hook
            #'magthe:lsp-next-checker<span class="org-rainbow-delimiters-depth-2">)</span><span class="org-rainbow-delimiters-depth-1">)</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Of course I have no idea if this is the easiest or most elegant solution but it
does work for my testcases:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Open a file in a project, <code>SPC p l</code> - choose project - choose a Haskell file.</li>
<li>Open a project, <code>SPC p l</code> followed by <code>C-d</code>, and then open a Haskell file.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Suggestions for improvements are more than welcome, of course.
