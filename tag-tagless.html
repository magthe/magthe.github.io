<p>
Early this summer it was finally time to put this one service I've been working
on into our sandbox environment. It's been running without hickups so last week
I turned it on for production as well. In this post I thought I'd document the
how and why of the service in the hope that someone will find it useful.
</p>

<p>
The service functions as an interface to external SMS-sending services, offering
a single place to change if we find that we are unhappy with the service we're
using.<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup> This service replaces an older one, written in Ruby and no one really
dares touch it. Hopefully the Haskell version will prove to be a joy to work
with over time.
</p>

<h2 id="org214f34f">Overview of the architecture</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org214f34f">
<p>
The service is split into two parts, one web server using <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/scotty">scotty</a>, and streaming
data processing using <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/conduit">conduit</a>. Persistent storage is provided by a <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a>
database. The general idea is that events are picked up from the database, acted
upon, which in turn results in other events which written to the database. Those
are then picked up and round and round we go. The web service accepts requests,
turns them into events and writes the to the database.
</p>

<p>
Hopefully this crude diagram clarifies it somewhat.

<p>
There are a few things that might need some explanation
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p>
In the past we've wanted to have the option to use multiple external SMS
services at the same time. One is randomly chosen as the request comes in.
There's also a possibility to configure the frequency for each external
service.
</p>

<p>
<i>Picker</i> implements the random picking and I've written about that earlier in
<a href="2019-02-17-000-choosing-a-conduit-randomly.html">Choosing a conduit randomly</a>.
</p>

<p>
<i>Success</i> and <i>fail</i> are dummy senders. They don't actually send anything, and
the former succeeds at it while the latter fails. I found them useful for
manual testing.
</p></li>

<li><p>
Successfully sending off a request to an external SMS service, getting status
200 back, doesn't actually mean that the SMS has been sent, or even that it
ever will be. Due to the nature of SMS messaging there are no guarantees of
timeliness at all. Since we are interested in finding out whether an SMS
actually is sent a delayed action is scheduled, which will fetch the status of
a sent SMS after a certain time (currently 2 minutes). If an SMS hasn't been
sent after that time it might as well never be &#x2013; it's too slow for our
end-users.
</p>

<p>
This is what <i>report-fetcher</i> and <i>fetcher-func</i> do.
</p></li>

<li>The <i>queue sink</i> and <i>queue src</i> are actually <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/stm-conduit-4.0.1/docs/Data-Conduit-TQueue.html#v:sourceTQueue"><code>sourceTQueue</code></a> and <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/stm-conduit-4.0.1/docs/Data-Conduit-TQueue.html#v:sinkTQueue"><code>sinkTQueue</code></a>.
Splitting the stream like that makes it trivial to push in events by using
<a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/stm-2.5.0.0/docs/Control-Concurrent-STM-TQueue.html#v:writeTQueue"><code>writeTQueue</code></a>.</li>

<li>I use <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/conduit-1.3.1.1/docs/Data-Conduit.html#v:sequenceConduits"><code>sequenceConduits</code></a> in order to send a single event to multiple
=Conduit=s and then combine all their results back into a single stream. The
ease with which this can be done in <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/conduit">conduit</a> is one of the main reasons why I
choose to use it.<sup><a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2">2</a></sup></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="org29b0e87">Effects and tests</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org29b0e87">
<p>
I started out writing everything based on a type like <code>ReaderT &lt;my cfg type&gt; IO</code>
and using <code>liftIO</code> for effects that needed lifting. This worked nicely while I
was setting up the basic structure of the service, but as soon as I hooked in
the database I really wanted to do some testing also of the effectful code.
</p>

<p>
After reading <a href="https://serokell.io/blog/2018/12/07/tagless-final">Introduction to Tagless Final</a> and
<a href="https://www.fpcomplete.com/blog/2017/06/readert-design-pattern">The ReaderT Design Patter</a>, playing a bit with both approaches, and writing
<a href="2019-01-20-000-tagless-final-and-scotty.html">Tagless final and Scotty</a> and
<a href="2019-02-02-000-the-readert-design-pattern-or-tagless-final-.html">The ReaderT design pattern or tagless final?</a>, I finally chose to go down the route
of <i>tagless final</i>. There's no strong reason for that decision, maybe it was
just because I read about it first and found it very easy to move in that
direction in small steps.
</p>

<p>
There's a split between property tests and unit tests:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Data types, their monad instances (like JSON (de-)serialisation), pure
functions and a few effects are tested using properties. I'm using <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/QuickCheck">QuickCheck</a>
for that. I've since looked a little closer at <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/hedgehog">hedgehog</a> and if I were to do a
major overhaul of the property tests I might be tempted to rewrite them using
that library instead.</li>

<li>Most of the =Conduit=s are tested using <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/HUnit">HUnit</a>.</li>
</ul>

<div id="outline-container-org98fd41b" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org98fd41b">Configuration</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org98fd41b">
<p>
The service will be run in a container and we try to follow the <a href="https://12factor.net/">12-factor app
rules</a>, where the third one says that configuration should be stored in the
environment. All previous Haskell projects I've worked on have been command line
tools were configuration is done (mostly) using command line argument. For that
I usually use <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/optparse-applicative">optparse-applicative</a>, but it's not applicable in this setting.
</p>

<p>
After a bit of searching on <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/">hackage</a> I settled on <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/etc">etc</a>. It turned out to be nice
an easy to work with. The configuration is written in JSON and only specifies
environment variables. It's then embedded in the executable using <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/file-embed">file-embed</a>.
The only thing I miss is a <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/aeson/docs/Data-Aeson.html#t:ToJSON"><code>ToJSON</code></a> instance for <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/etc-0.4.1.0/docs/System-Etc.html#t:Config"><code>Config</code></a> &#x2013; we've found it
quite useful to log the active configuration when starting a service and that
log entry would become a bit nicer if the message was JSON rather than the
(somewhat difficult to read) string that <code>Config</code>'s <code>Show</code> instance produces.

<div id="outline-container-org8788723" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org8788723">Logging</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org8788723">
<p>
There are two requirements we have when it comes to logging
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>All log entries tied to a request should have a <a href="https://hilton.org.uk/blog/microservices-correlation-id">correlation ID</a>.</li>
<li>Log requests and responses</li>
</ol>

<p>
I've written about correlation ID before, <a href="2018-10-01-000-using-a-configuration-in-scotty.html">Using a configuration in Scotty</a>.
</p>

<p>
Logging requests and responses is an area where I'm not very happy with <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/scotty">scotty</a>.
It feels natural to solve it using middleware (i.e. using <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/scotty/docs/Web-Scotty.html#v:middleware"><code>middleware</code></a>) but the
representation, especially of responses, is a bit complicated so for the time
being I've skipped logging the body of both. I'd be most interested to hear of
libraries that could make that easier.

<div id="outline-container-org2b55605" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org2b55605">Data storage and picking up new events</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org2b55605">
<p>
The data stream processing depends heavily on being able to pick up when new
events are written to the database. Especially when there are more than one
instance running (we usually have at least two instance running in the
production environment). To get that working I've used <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/postgresql-simple">postgresql-simple</a>'s
support for <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-listen.html"><code>LISTEN</code></a> and <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-notify.html"><code>NOTIFY</code></a> via the function <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/postgresql-simple-0.6.2/docs/Database-PostgreSQL-Simple-Notification.html#v:getNotification"><code>getNotification</code></a>.
</p>

<p>
When I wrote about this earlier, <a href="2019-03-03-000-conduit-and-postgresql.html">Conduit and PostgreSQL</a> I got some really good
feedback that made my solution more robust.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org2cf7562">
<p>
Some things in Haskell feel almost like cheating. The light-weight threading
makes me confident that a <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base/docs/Control-Concurrent.html#v:forkIO"><code>forkIO</code></a> followed by a <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base/docs/Control-Concurrent.html#v:threadDelay"><code>threadDelay</code></a> (or in my case,
the ones from <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/unliftio">unliftio</a>) will suffice.
