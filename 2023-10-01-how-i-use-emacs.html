<p>
I've recently written <a href="https://magnus.therning.org/2023-09-10-using-emacs-for-the-scrollback-in-terminal-multiplexers.html">two</a> <a href="https://magnus.therning.org/2023-09-30-using-emacs-as-$editor.html">posts</a> about my attempts to use a slimmed down Emacs
setup for some very specific use cases. I'be put both posts on Reddit, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/16f7rbn/using_emacs_for_the_scrollback_in_terminal/">here</a> and
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/16w9bvh/using_emacs_as_editor/">here</a>, and in both cases the majority of comments have been telling me that I
should use <code>emacsclient</code>. I know they have good intentions &#x2013; they want to share
insight they've gained and benefit from on a daily basis. However, no matter how
many Emacs devotees point out the benefits of <code>emacsclient</code> I'm not about to
start using it. This post is an attempt to answer why that is.
</p>

<p>
Up front I want to clarify a few things:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Yes, I know how to use <code>emacsclient</code>, and</li>
<li>yes, I know it is a good way to, in a way, improve Emacs startup time,<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1" role="doc-backlink">1</a></sup> and</li>
<li>yes, I know how to turn on <code>server-mode</code> in Emacs, and finally</li>
<li>yes, I know how to run Emacs using a user unit for SystemD.</li>
</ol>

<p>
With that out of the way, here are the two ways I use Emacs
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>As my starting point for work, i.e. writing code, keeping notes, tracking
time, and writing my daily work journal.</li>
<li>As my editor of ephemeral files.<sup><a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2" role="doc-backlink">2</a></sup></li>
</ol>

<p>
The next two sections explain more about these two distinct ways I use Emacs

<p>
Much of what I do on a daily basis starts in Emacs. I typically have one
instance of Emacs open and I always keep it on the second virtual desktop. I
always run it in the GUI. When I write code I start with opening a new tab, then
I open a <code>dired</code> buffer in the project's folder (by using <code>consult-projectile</code>).
When I need a terminal I open it from Emacs using on of
<code>terminal-here-project-launch</code> or <code>terminal-here</code>. Occasionally I open a shell
prompt inside Emacs using <code>shell-pop</code>.
</p>

<p>
Back when I used Vim as my main editor I <i>always</i> started a terminal first and
then opened files from there. Since switching to Emacs I've completely stopped
doing that. Over the last 8 or so years of Emacs usage there's only been a
handful of times when I've wanted to open a file from the terminal and I've run
<code>M-x server-start</code> and used <code>emacsclient</code>. The last time was more than a year
ago.
</p>

<p>
As I typically keep exactly one Emacs open, and I start it soon after logging
in, I'm not too concerned with startup time. I think under 2s is more than fast
enough given the functionality I have in my setup.
</p>

<p>
This setup I use for taking notes and writing my daily work journal, as well as
reading email, and programming in a half-dozen languages. I have a large-ish set
of keybindings that I've set up using <a href="https://github.com/noctuid/general.el">general.el</a>, inspired by Spacemacs at first
but by now it's started to gain its own character.

<p>
Ephemeral files are files I tend to edit for less than 30 seconds, maybe a
minute at most. There are three main use cases for ephemeral files:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Searching the scrollback buffer in <a href="https://zellij.dev/">zellij</a>, and copying bits to the clipboard
for various uses.</li>
<li>Editing files when running <code>git</code> from the command line. It's not something I
do very often, but it happens.</li>
<li>Editing shell commands. When they get a little too large to handle
conveniently using ZSH directly I invoke <code>edit-command-line</code>.</li>
</ol>

<p>
For a few reasons I decided to make a second, completely separate configuration
just to handle ephemeral files.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>It will only be used in a terminal.</li>
<li>I want to be able to have some special keybindings that suit a specific use,
e.g. for the scrollback buffer I've bound `SPC Y` to copy the selected text to
the clipboard and then exit Emacs. It's a thing that I use all the time with
the scrollback buffer, but never otherwise.</li>
<li>I have no need, nor any desire, to switch from editing a commit message, or
searching a scrollback buffer, to reading email or editing an org-mode file.
The complete separation is a feature.</li>
</ul>

<p>
With a startup time of less than a quarter of a second it is well within the
acceptable, and there is absolutely no need to use <code>emacsclient</code> just to speed
things up. Given my desire for separation, I wouldn't want to use my main Emacs
instance as a server and edit ephemeral files anyway.

<h2 id="orgcadf982">Conclusion</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgcadf982">
<p>
I've found a setup that seems to work really well and tick all the requirements
I have when it comes to separation between use cases and ability to have custom
keybindings for them. Also, Emacs is starting up <i>very</i> fast with my slimmed
down configuration. If starting Emacs with the slimmed configuration starts
taking too long I'm more likely to go back to using Neovim than complicate
things with <code>emacsclient</code>.
</p>

<p>
So no, I am not going to start using <code>emacsclient</code> any time soon.
