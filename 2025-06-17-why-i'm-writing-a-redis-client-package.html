<p>
A couple of weeks ago I needed a small, hopefully temporary, service at work. It
bridges a gap in functionality provided by a legacy system and the functionality
desired by a new system. The legacy system is cumbersome to work with, so we
tend to prefer building anti-corruption layers rather than changing it directly,
and sometimes we implement it as separate services.
</p>

<p>
This time it was good enough to run the service as a cronjob, but it did need to
keep track of when it ran the last time. It felt silly to spin up a separate DB
just to keep a timestamp, and using another service's DB is something I <i>really</i>
dislike and avoid.<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1" role="doc-backlink">1</a></sup> So, I ended up using the Redis instance that's used as a
cache by a OSS service we host.
</p>

<p>
The last time I had a look at the options for writing a Redis client in Haskell
I found two candidates, <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/hedis">hedis</a> and <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/redis-io">redis-io</a>. At the time I wrote a <a href="https://magnus.therning.org/2021-05-07-working-with-hedis.html">short note</a>
about them. This time around I found nothing much has changed, they are still
the only two contenders and they still suffer from the same issues
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><i>hedis</i> has still has the same API and I still find it as awkward.</li>
<li><i>redis-io</i> still requires a logger.</li>
</ul>

<p>
I once again decided to use <i>hedis</i> and wrote the service for work in a couple
of days, but this time I thought I'd see what it would take to remove the
requirement on <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/tinylog">tinylog</a> from <i>redis-io</i>. I spent a few evenings on it, though I
spent most time on "modernising" the dev setup, using Nix to build, re-format
using <i>fourmolu</i>, etc. I did the same for <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/redis-resp">redis-resp</a>, the main dependency of
<i>redis-io</i>. The result of that can be fount on my gitlab account:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://gitlab.com/magus/redis-resp">https://gitlab.com/magus/redis-resp</a></li>
<li><a href="https://gitlab.com/magus/redis-io">https://gitlab.com/magus/redis-io</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
At the moment I won't take that particular experiment any further and given that
the most recent change to <i>redis-io</i> was in 2020 (according to its <a href="https://gitlab.com/twittner/redis-io/">git repo</a>)
I don't think there's much interest upstream either.
</p>

<p>
Making the changes to <i>redis-io</i> and <i>redis-resp</i> made me a little curious about
the <a href="https://redis.io/docs/latest/develop/reference/protocol-spec/">Redis protocol</a> so I started reading about it. It made me start thinking
about implementing a client lib myself. How hard could it be?
</p>

<p>
I'd also asked a question about Redis client libs on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/1kk4a5v/redis_lib_for_haskell/">r/haskell</a> and a response
led me to <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/redis-schema">redis-schema</a>. It has a very good README, and its section on
transactions with its observation that Redis transactions are a perfect match
for <code>Applicative</code>. This pushed me even closer to start writing a client lib.
What pushed me over the edge was the realisation that <a href="https://redis.io/docs/latest/develop/use/pipelining/">pipelining</a> also is a
perfect match for <code>Applicative</code>.
</p>

<p>
For the last few weeks I've spent some of my free time reading and experimenting
and I'm enjoying it very much. We'll see where it leads, but hopefully I'll at
least have bit more to write about it.
