<p>
Over the last week I've completely rebuilt the the only on-premise system we
have at work. One of the bits I'm rather happy with is the replacement of
<a href="https://mmonit.com/">M/Monit</a> with just plain <a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/">systemd</a>. We didn't use any of the advanced features of
M/Monit, we only wanted ordinary process monitoring and restart on a single
system. It really was a bit of overkill.
</p>

<p>
So, instead of
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>using M/Monit to monitor processes</li>
<li>a monit configuration for the app (both start and stop instructions)</li>
<li>a script to start the app and capture its PID in a file</li>
<li>a script to resync the app against the S3 bucket where Travis puts the build
artifacts, and if a new version has arrived, remove the PID file thereby
triggering M/Monit to restart the app</li>
<li>a crontab entry to run the sync/restart script every few minutes</li>
</ul>

<p>
we now have
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>a (simplified) script to start the app<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup></li>
<li>a service unit (<code>app.service</code>) for the app</li>
<li>a timer unit (<code>app-sync.timer</code>) to trigger the resync of the app against the
S3 bucket</li>
<li>a oneshot service unit (<code>app-sync.service</code>), triggered by the timer, to
perform the sync of the app with the latest build, i.e. call <code>aws s3 sync</code></li>
<li>a path unit (<code>app-restart.path</code>) to monitor one of the build artifacts, i.e.
to pick up that a new version has arrived</li>
<li>a oneshot service unit (<code>app-restart.service</code>), triggered by the path unit,
calling <code>systemctl restart app.service</code></li>
</ul>

<p>
There's one more piece to the setup, but
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>the start script is simplified since it no longer needs to push things to the
background and capture the PID</li>
<li>the sync/restart script is completely gone (arguably the more complicated of
the two scripts in the M/Monit setup)</li>
<li>responsibility is cleanly separated leading to a solution that's easier to
understand (as long as you know a bit about systemd of course)</li>
</ul>

<p>
so I think it's a net improvement.

All it does is set a bunch of environment variables and then start the
app, so I'm planning on moving the environment variables into a separate file
and put the start command the service unit file instead.
